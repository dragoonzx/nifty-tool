# ðŸš€ Web3 Frontend Starter Template

## Local launch

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Run the server with `yarn start`

## Available Scripts

- `yarn start` â€” runs the app in the development mode
- `yarn build` â€” builds the app for production to the `docs` folder
- `yarn lint` â€” checks if the code is linted and formatted
- `yarn generate-css-types` â€” generates the CSS types for `tailwind-css`

## Features

- State management + persistence with `valtio` and `PersistableStore`
- `preact` under the hood with `preact/compat` makes it compatible with virtually any `react` library but still makes it faster
- Full TypeScript support â€” no dangling types
- `vite` packager and devtools make building and development lightning fast
- `tailwind-css` built-in with type-safe class names
- `prettier` and `eslint` configured, enabled and formatting your code on save
- List of recommended extensions for VSCode
- It is important to keep the bundle small, so a `stats.html` file is generated on `yarn build` to visually show you the bundle size
